👋 Hi, I’m @mandywell, a tech-savvy empath with a deep understanding of human needs. I know how to navigate the complexities of modern tech and also the intricate nuances of human emotions. I usually opt for a hands-on approach to solving problems and making things. 

💞️ I'm most excited about AI and its impact on the world of work. There is so much to unpack, whether it's the adoption and integration of AI or what skills are needed moving forward. This hits on many of my passion areas: a bit of Workforce Planning (but broader), research, L&D, policy and regulation, etc...a little bit of everything. I want to ensure everyone can access free or low-cost tools to increase productivity, enhance our lives, and ensure no one gets left behind.

👀 My Data Lens ...

In many organizations, especially smaller ones, accessing sophisticated data analytics tools or hiring a dedicated data analytics team can be a significant financial challenge. Yet, deriving meaningful insights from workforce data shouldn't be a privilege reserved for those with deep pockets. By leveraging free, powerful tools such as R and Python, we can effectively bridge the gap between the need for analytics and budget constraints. 

Learning how to use these tools might seem overwhelming amidst the daily hustle. Believe me, I know. I've been there. But remember, every expert was once a beginner. Let's embrace the challenge of learning the basics and go beyond. We can do this together. Let's use the remarkable capabilities of today's Generative AI models including ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity.ai and Claude, as your "always-on" tutor. These models can significantly enhance your learning curve and boost your skills. 

This GitHub repository serves as my exploration playground, where I experiment with and share code that enables us to tackle analytical challenges together. Here, we can contribute, learn, and benefit from shared experiences and knowledge. 

🌱 I’m currently:  Deepening my knowledge of R and am enjoying using R to find insights in data.
